This was definitely a challenging assignment. There were issues in the beginning involving relationships between classes. I had originally used association between the bank-branch-user-account classes when it should have been aggression. After overcoming this obstacle, passing the objects from class to the main could be done with only the parameter of a bank as the bank contained lists of branches which had lists of users which had accounts connected to it. This overall taught the importance of modularity and class relationships. Following my initial timeline for the project was challenging as I was away for half of the time given. In addition I was completing the two person assignment alone. If I had more time I would've liked to add in more bulletproofing for inputted values, such as a withdrawal amount cannot be a string or have more than 2 decimals. I would've also liked to add in the function of a user having multiple accounts, each with checking and saving values. I could've improved on my commenting throughout the program but as you could imagine I was rushed on getting the program to run instead of describing what it does.
